SELF CARE
</p>
<p>Self-care encourages you to maintain a healthy relationship with yourself so that you can transmit the good feelings to others.
Self-care is an important activity to do every day. Doing so will lead toward a better balance among your dimensions of wellness and lead toward improved overall health and wellness. 
It means giving ourselves the same grace, compassion, and care that we give to others.</p>
